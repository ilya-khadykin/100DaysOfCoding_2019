My participation in #100DaysOfCoding challange as a new year's resolution

## 100DaysOfCoding
### [Day 6](https://medium.com/@mageofit/100daysofcoding-day-6-checking-if-an-array-is-consecutive-using-java-d709b138e53c)
[hecking if an array is consecutive using Java](./java/src/main/java/MakeArrayConsecutive2.java). Main feature of my solution — I’ve used existing code from standard library `Arrays` class.

Outcomes:
* revisited 'Arrays' class - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html

### [Day 5](https://medium.com/@mageofit/100daysofcoding-day-5-computing-an-area-of-a-polygon-using-java-cab152870157)
Wrote a [solution for computing an area of a polygon](./java/src/main/java/ShapeArea.java). It wasn’t that hard to figure it out, but it required some drawings on paper to come up with the correct solution.

I’ve faced `StackOverflowError` for my first solution that used recursion. It was disappointing but instructive.

Outcomes:
* remembered that recursion has its pitfalls,
* made sure once again that drawing on paper helps a lot and reduces an actual time spent on coding.

### [Day 4](https://medium.com/@mageofit/100daysofcoding-day-4-find-max-product-of-adjacent-elements-in-an-array-using-java-be49bc2344c5)
Wrote a solution for [finding maximum product of adjacent elements in an array using Java](./java/src/main/java/AdjacentElementsProduct.java). It was easy to do it using `for` loop, it will be interesting to rewrite my solution using streams from Java 8

### [Day 3](https://medium.com/@mageofit/100daysofcoding-day-3-check-for-palindrome-in-java-e1c496486427)
Wrote [solution for checking if a String is a Palindrome in Java](./java/src/main/java/CheckPalindrome.java).

Outcomes:
* revised java doc for String class;
* used paper to write pseudo-code before starting writing actual code;
* looked into unit tests for the exercise and usage of `assert` Java.

### [Day 2](https://medium.com/@mageofit/100daysofcoding-day-2-the-first-java-coding-problem-5c446807d1d6)
Familiarize myself with [Codesignal Arcade](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade) and solved pretty simple code quiz - [centuryFromYear](./java/src/main/java/CenturyFromYear.java)

### [Day 1 ](https://medium.com/@mageofit/taking-part-in-100daysofcoding-as-my-new-year-resolution-day-1-b0f0058da447)
Set up an development environment and solved [Two-Fer](./python/two-fer/) exercise from exercism.io by using string format introduced in Python 3
